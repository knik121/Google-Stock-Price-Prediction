Stock price prediction using LSTM

This project demonstrates how to predict stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The dataset is taken from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreenidhihipparagi/google-stock-prediction/data 

It is then split into mainly two parts- training and testing upon which, the model is built trained and applied. The result gives a fairly accurate prediction.

The following Python packages are required to run the code:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
